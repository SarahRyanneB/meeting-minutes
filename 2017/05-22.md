## ANSI handling in nteract + Hydrogen

As we run into performance problems of recomputing ansi styles, it's growing increasingly likely that we'll
want to maintain a terminal state for all the ANSI handling well above the React tree. Since color codes can span multiple lines we cannot simply parse line by line. In general we always need to parse the whole string.

The terminal would need to track at least the cursor position and the current ANSI environement ("active" ANSI escape codes).

Rough notes from the whiteboard:

## Removing Immutable from transforms

It would be helpful for Hydrogen if we could get away from using Immutable.js in the transforms.
We would likely accept frozen objects instead. To make it only be a minor release, we could make Immutable.js
an optional dependency and check if an object is an Immutable.js one.


## Mozilla Global Sprint

Hydrogen participates in the [Mozilla Global Sprint](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/) from June 1st to 2nd. [Registrations](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/project-lead/) are still open if nteract would like to be a part of it as well.
