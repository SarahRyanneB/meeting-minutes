## ANSI handling in nteract + Hydrogen

As we run into performance problems of recomputing ansi styles, it's growing increasingly likely that we'll
want to maintain a terminal state for all the ANSI handling well above the React tree.

Rough notes from the whiteboard:

## Removing Immutable from transforms

It would be helpful for Hydrogen if we could get away from using Immutable.js in the transforms.
We would likely accept frozen objects instead. To make it only be a minor release, we could make Immutable.js
an optional dependency and check if an object is an Immutable.js one.
