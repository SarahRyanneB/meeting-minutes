# Webpack + electron-builder

* Current shipped app is ~512MB uncompressed and installed
* Webpack bundled JS is ~8MB

We can get our size down to just the webpack bits + electron + assets.

# Focus cell

We need to get our focus cell + scrolling UX down. Creating sketches and design documentation around this will help us.

# Flow style guide

* Create a flow style guide to help everyone
* Enforce flow on Travis

# JavaScript kernel

We need to make installation and usage of JavaScript kernel incredible

# rx-jupyter

* Wrapper for Jupyter APIs
* RxJS based, uses `.ajax` for all REST API calls

```
kernel$ = jupyter.kernels.start(server, 'python3', '/home/kyle')
```

# ZMQ

* Extracting Windows Library to another package (for now a tag)

# Electron builder

* Windows worked awesome, was able to build with only `npm install -g windows-build-tools` and nteract from git
* Windows nteract release built on 64-bit machine - will it break on 32-bit Windows?
* Mac build was awesome
