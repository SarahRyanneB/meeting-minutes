__Present__
- @captainsafia
- @rgbkrk
- @lgeiger
- @jdetle
- @nikitakit

__Past Happenings__
- @lgeiger took a look at trying to fix zmq-prebuilt for Windows
  - Electron 1.2 and above don't work on Windows because the prebuilt needs to be built on Electron headers not Node headers
  - Did not get far but at least we can build on all platforms now that we have the right headers
- @lgeiger added some tests for Hydrogen — yay!
- @captainsafia worked on adding tests and worked on some issues in the beta milestone
  - We are now at 82% coverage — close to the 90% coverage for beta release
- @jdetle complete the live-rendering Markdown cell mentioned last meeting and got it working
- @jdetle also got authentication via GitHub working so now non-anonymous gists can be published
- @nikitakit looking to include features into Hydrogen that would involve adding a plugins API
- Reminder to everyone that the soft deadline for the beta is mid-November
- @rgbkrk nerds out on comms starting now
  - nteract does not currently implement the comms component of the Jupyter API
    - comms are a free-form two-way communication layer between the kernel and the front-end
   - The problem we are trying to address is __synchronizing a view with a model in the backend__
    - For example, changing a slider widget changes a variable in 
   - Collaborating with @jupyterlab to figure out how the comms spec would be done
   - Probably not going to be done in time for beta because it is a long term kind of thing
   - Check out some of the ideas scoped out around this in [synchronized-obejct-diff-spec](
https://github.com/rgbkrk/synchronized-object-diff-spec)
- @rgbkrk mentions that we now have a real server for nteract the website and the GitHub auth endpoint
  - Everything is HTTPs now!
  - Easier automation now!


__Next Steps__
- @lgeiger mentions that there are a few plugin-related PRs in Hydrogen
  - Would love to merge these PRs but would like a review from an third party
  - @nikitakit hoping to implement lifecycle hooks into kernel processes
    - For example, plugins have access to post-`execute_reply` to process replies before they are sent to Atom
  - Multiple approaches to doing plugins
    - @rgkbkrk says is it possible for us to pick any implementation now and change it as the needs change
    - @rgbkrk reviewed PRs but hard to get a sense of the impact of the plugin-related PRs
  - @nikitakit says that a plugin should leverage the Atom event API
  - @rgbkrk preaches about streams because he cannot get enough of streams
- @captainsafia will work on some of the React-focused issues in the beta mileston
- @jdetle will work on improving the GitHub auth workflow and bug fixes
- @rgbkrk says that we should probably add more JSDocs to nteract
- The focus for this alpha sprint is one improving the Editor component
