Watch the [nteract meeting on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI8PDi6Uj1A) if you missed out and want to catch up! Closed captioning is in progress, will get posted in the next couple days. 😊

## Overview

* There are folks wanting to work on a Python project during the sprint, who chimed in the #global-sprint channel on slack. @Carreau has volunteered to help lead in Python areas. 
* Lots of gratitude went around in helping each other learn JavaScript and the overall project. Props given and received amongst @lgeiger, @alexandercbooth, and @BenRussert.
* We are in agreement about enabling bots across the org. Both lock and stale. 🤖 
* @emeeks asked about promoting the sprints further to bring in collaborators to work on the [Data Explorer 📊](https://github.com/nteract/global-sprint/blob/master/projects/data-explorer.md), and he has [tweeted out a call to action](https://twitter.com/Elijah_Meeks/status/1017449105864327174)
* _People will show up during the weekend of 7/28-7/29 during the sprints to collaborate together, at Netflix_

* @BenRussert is going to work on the [docs project](https://github.com/nteract/global-sprint/blob/master/projects/docs.md), to help the dev docs get further along and build his own understanding  [📝](https://github.com/nteract/global-sprint/blob/master/projects/docs.md)
* Further interest in expanding the nteract.io/kernels page to help users get all their environments working well across hydrogen and nteract 🌽 
* @rgbkrk sketched out the style of dev docs he's hoping for, making sure we can handle teaching people how to onboard to the project as well as deep dive into how to use components and libraries.
  * Primary pillars are:
    * Tutorials
    * Guides
    * Component Docs
    * Library APIs
  * Example of docs done well [Reach Router](https://reach.tech/router)
  * Tools we're using under the hood currently:
    * [React Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/)
    * [React Docgen](https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen)
