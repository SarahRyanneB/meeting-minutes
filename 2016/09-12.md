__Past Happenings__

- ZMQ prebuilds on Travis are working for Linux and OS X
  - Issues with Windows build — static linking needs to be written
  - Running `npm version` and `git push --tags` to automatically build and publish prebuilds
  - What happens if there are no binaries are available for a machine?
    - Fallback and do a build of libzmq on the user's system at install
    - Issue opened for this at nteract/zmq-prebuilt#41
  - @gnestor asks what are the advantages of `zmq-prebuilt`?
    - `zmq` is notoriously difficult to install, `node-gyp` is a hassle to use, we want to make the process of
    getting native bindings for zmq easier
    - Solves a lot of the issues that were experienced with atom-notebook
  - Problem: prebuilds tend to break if Electron updates and ABI versions are out of sync
    - Discussion thread on this issue [here](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/5851)
- @rgbkrk has been working on cleaning up parts of the codebase to make it easier to test and for exporting the components for web use
- Goal is to have 90% test coverage by the time of the beta release
  - Currently at 73% test coverage
- New custom transforms via transformime-react render of Plotly and GeoJSON in the notebook
- Addition of authentication flow for GitHub for publishing secret gists
  - @jdetle to implement authentication workflow with the Electron dialog API
  - The alternative is to implement a React component for the dialog box that we can then style as desired
    - This will probably be done eventually but start using Electron's dialog API to figure out the workflow
- @jdetle asks if there is an ability for us to do live rendering on Markdown
- @lgeiger has discovered that some of nteract packages that have documentation include them in the published releases
  - Edit .npmignore files in these repositories to include `docs/` folder
- @lgeiger created `nteract/term-launcher` which allows the spawning of consoles or Jupyter kernels from Node
- Remote kernel interface in `nteract/hydrogen` is feature-complete 
- @gnestor asks what are the benefits of using `zmq` over othe protocols for communicating with kernels?
  - Using `zmq` allows interopability with the rest of the Jupyter ecosystem
- @rgbkrk proposes that it would be great to have the IPython Codemirror mode as an npm package for easier use
  - Issue for that opened in nteract/nteract#389
- Cool news: Berkeley is now using the `nteract/hydrogen` in one of their courses

__Next Steps__
- @rgbkrk to make another release today, also figure out how to build nteract on Docker
- @captainsafia to work on tests and small fixes inside the Notebook
- @lgeiger to work on/review PRs on adding a plugin API for nteract/hydrogen
  - @n-riesco to help with code review
- @n-riesco to catch up on code and latest developments on `nteract/hydrogen` and work on JavaScript/Coffeescript kernels
  - @n-riesco to release a JavaScript-prebuilt kernel that relies on `zmq-prebuilt`
- @gnestor has not contributed to nteract yet but is hoping to make some contributions — has experience with React and Atom development
- @jdetle to write some tests, study up on redux-observable, and work on GitHub authentication workflow
