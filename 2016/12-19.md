Peggy: Over the next couple weeks will be working on the commutable refactor (https://github.com/nteract/commutable/issues/51) & the provider refactor (take all the redux stuff out of the components, set up callbacks).

Kyle: Wrote a JS kernel (https://github.com/rgbkrk/ikernel), cleaning up my WIP PRs, and helping others.

Lukas: Focusing on zeromq, prebuild, prebuild-install. With the next release of prebuild-install, we should be able to use `yarn`!

John: Slept through meeting. Is working on pdf printing and thinking on other features for nteract, should do more testing, rx-jupyter dashboard, and continue work on blog post about the current state of sharing in notebooks.
