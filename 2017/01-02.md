# Figure out how to get started with lerna and monorepo

Possible package structure:

* `packages` (all the exported `@nteract/*` packages)
  - `transformime-react`
  - `notebook-editor`
* Electron app folder
* Web app folder (someday in the future)

If we need extra help, we could possibly pay Henry Zhu, James Kyle, or another lerna developer.

# Native Dependency Cleanup

* https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/1302
* vega → … → canvas
* Canvas is optional dependency, we wish it was a peer dep
* https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/pull/813

Aside: Kyle worked on `lit`, a lodash/fp based notebook architecture, will open source soon. Created it mainly to experiment with a different in-memory representation of the notebook while using `flow` heavily.
