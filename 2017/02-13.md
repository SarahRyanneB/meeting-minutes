# Monorepo

## Extracting more components and libraries

Next up:

* Display Area
* Input box (?)

Plan out exporting:

* Cell (maybe Editor separate)
* Reducers
* Epics


## Finish up transpilation for current components

* Commutable
* Transforms

## Creating a new version of notebook preview

Old notebook preview usage

* https://nb.surge.sh/ -- the original
* https://nteract-commuter.herokuapp.com/ -- deployed with commuter

Need to keep exporting components, build up a new version for use

## Style exports

* Need to export styles for our components, allow for theming
* Explore aphrodite and other CSS in JS solutions

# Provider Refactor

* Audit code in components (John, continue on with work from Peggy & Safia)
* Think on a config component to handle keybindings for one source of truth
  * We should think about how this integrates with Codemirror
* Cell component should switch between two “modes” - code / markdown - instead of having two separate components
  * Benefit: keep the same `<Editor>` when switching modes (this would keep the user’s cursor in place when switching)

# Commuter

* Short term - scope CSS styling for the original notebook preview
* Long term - continue exporting components and CSS from nteract/nteract

# Backpressure

Handling Velocity and Volume of messages

* Implement a fuse to trigger when too much flowing in
* For the users' sake, implement autosave at a constant interval if the notebook has a filename
  * Possibly implement a save-before-first-execute feature to prevent loss of the notebooks

# Metadata

* Carve out an nteract namespace
* Move our current metadata into the nteract namespace
* Experiment with comments
* Require specifications and expect migrations in the future
